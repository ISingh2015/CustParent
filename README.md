#CRM Build

Contains common maven spring modules & CRM artifacts for building CRM webservice components. The components are broken down into a number of modules and need to be downloaded locally before the build file can be executed locally. To see a list of modules to be downloaded and built, please see [CRM Build module](https://github.com/ISingh2015/CustBuild)
